# Rice 
As a cereal grain domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for over half of the world's human population especially in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production after sugarcane and maize.
## Choice of Location 
Low-lying areas that remain flooded 
## Weather Requirements 
Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37ï¿½ C 
## Culitvation 
  - ### Soil Preperation 
    Clay or clay loams are most suited for rice cultivation. Such soils are capable of holding water for long and sustain crop. Rice being a semi-aquatic crop, grows best under sub-merge conditions. Rice is cultivated in almost all types of soils with varying productivity. 
  - ### Seeding 
    There are three principal methods of direct seeding of rice (DSR): dry seeding (sowing dry seeds into dry soil), wet seeding (sowing pre-germinated seeds on wet puddled soils) and water seeding (seeds sown into standing water 
  - ### Planting 
    The seeds are sown in prepared beds, and when the seedlings are 25 to 50 days old, they are transplanted to a field, or paddy, that has been enclosed by levees and submerged under 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches) of water, remaining submerged during the growing season 
  - ### Careing 
    ay close attention to water management and timing of nitrogen applications. Take care of any problem weeds early 
  - ### Harvesting 
    Rice is manually threshed, then cleaned with a machine thresher. A reaper cuts and lays the crop in a line. Threshing and cleaning can then be performed manually or by machine. The combine harvester combines all operations from paddy harvesting to rice extraction - cutting, handling, threshing and cleaning.
