# Maize 
Maize (Zea mays L.) is the world’s leading crop and is widely cultivated as cereal grain. It is one of the most versatile emerging crops having wider adaptability. Globally maize is known as queen of cereals because of its highest genetic yield potential. Maize is the only food cereal crop that can be grown in diverse seasons ecologies and uses.,
## Choice of Location 
Maize does well on a wide range of climatic conditions, and it is grown in the tropical as well as temperate regions, from sea-levels up to altitudes of 2500m. It is however susceptible to frost at all stages of its growth. 
## Weather Requirements 
The maize crop requires sufficient moisture in the soil since its inception. Temperature of 18 to 23 degree Celsius for deposition and 28 degree Celsius temperature is considered good for growth and development. Maize can be grown in all types of soil. 
## Culitvation 
  - ### Soil Preparation 
    Maize requires a firm and compact seedbed free from stubbles and weed. One deep ploughing should be given, followed by two or three harrowings to bring the soil to a fine tilth 
  - ### Seeding 
    Maize is mainly sown directly through seed by using different methods of tillage & establishment. Recently, resource conservation technologies (RCTs) namely, zero tillage, minimum tillage, surface seeding etc. had came in practice in various maize based cropping system and are cost effective and environment friendly. Following are major planting methods that vary from situation to situation.        
  - ### Planting 
    Maize is sown in rows, 60-75 cm apart, whereas the plants in the row are spaced at 20 to 25 cm. A population of 60-75 thousand plants per hectare at harvest are required for obtaining the optimum yield. Sowing in rows is generally done with drill or by dropping the seed behind the plough. 
  - ### Careing 
    Corn plants aren�t very thirsty so wait until the soil is completely dry before you water themSpray with a mister every few days for a humidity boost. Corn plants can grow in most light conditions, just keep them away from harsh sunlight to avoid sunburn.
  - ### Harvesting 
    Your maize is mature when the leaves and the husks start to dry and turn yellow. Start harvesting improved varieties first and end with local varieties which are more resistant to pest attacks. Dehusk your maize in the field to avoid bringing pests to your home.
