# Wheat 
Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed.A cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food. 
## Choice of Location 
 Wheat grows best in full sunlight, in well-drained loamy soil. 
## Weather Requirements 
Weather that is comfortable for humans is also good for wheat. Wheat needs 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38 centimeters) of water to produce a good crop. It grows best when temperatures are warm, from 70° to 75° F (21° to 24° C), but not too hot. Wheat also needs a lot of sunshine, especially when the grains are filling. 
## Culitvation 
  - ### Soil Preparation 
    Plough twice with an iron plough and two to three times with cultivator and prepare the land to a fine tilth.Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. 
  - ### Seeding 
    The recommendation is to plant between 1.2 and 2.2 million seeds per acre. Seeding rates on the lower end of the range should be used when planting within a week of the fly-free-date to avoid overly thick stands that can promote disease development and increase the likelihood of lodging the following season. 
  - ### Planting 
    The wheat seeds must be sown in about 4 to 5 cm inside the soil. Always put the seeds in rows and maintain a spacing of 20-22.5 cm between the rows. Planting or sowing the seeds in the right time is also important as delayed sowing can cause a gradual decline in the production. 
  - ### Careing 
    Watering – good and proper irrigation is required for wheat farming. First irrigation must be done after 20 to 25 days after planting the seeds. Then, additional 4 to 5 irrigation should be done after every 20 days. Weeding: Most of the weeds in your field can be controlled while preparing the soil. 
  - ### Harvesting 
    A combine is used to harvest the crop. This machine combines reaping, threshing, and winnowing. The edible wheat is put into the back of the combine. It is then put into a grain cart, and then into a semi truck where it is transported to be stored in a grain elevator.
