# Apple 
## Choice of Location 
The best placement for a single tree or a grove of apple trees is in full sun, in well-drained soil, away from other trees and outside of any low-lying area that could form a "frost pocket" where cold air settles. 
## Weather Requirements 
The average summer temperature should be around 21-24oC during active growth period. Apple succeeds best in regions where the trees experience uninterrupted rest in winter and abundant sunshine for good colour development. It can be grown at an altitude of 1500- 2700 m above the sea level. 
## Culitvation 
  - ### Soil Preparation 
    Soil preparation can be done at any time of year that the ground is not overly saturated with water or frozen. \n Your lawn can provide you with ideal organic materials such as grass clippings and shredded leaves. Not only will the grass and leaves break down to provide soil nutrients naturally, but they will help loosen the soil as well. You can gather these in the fall with spring planting in mind.\n Adding organic materials like compost will improve the composition of most every soil type. Organic materials bind sandy soil particles so they retain moisture and nutrients better. They also break apart clay and silt particles, so that water can soak in and roots can spread. 
  - ### Seeding 
    After a minimum of 6 weeks in a moist paper towel in the refrigerator, you can plant apple seeds just as you would any other seed.  They can be direct seeded outdoors if it’s after last spring frost and the soil can be worked.  Since germination rates are low, and predation from squirrels, mice, and voles can be an issue early on, we generally sprout them in pots. 
  - ### Planting 
    The best time to plant apple trees is in the spring, like all other fruit trees, though the fall can work with the understanding that there are risks if there's a harsh winter ahead. Don't focus on frost dates in the early spring and late winter. 
  - ### Careing 
    Apple trees need at least 8 hours of sun per day during the growing season.Two varieties are required for successful pollination; one can be a crabapple.Dwarf apple trees will start bearing fruit 2 to 3 years after planting.Standard size trees can take up to 8 years to bear fruit.Some varieties are more susceptible to insect and disease damage than others.Prune annually to keep apple trees healthy and productive 
  - ### Harvesting 
    Apple Harvesting Normally the apples are ready for harvest from September-October except in the Nilgiris where the season is from April to July. The fruits mature within 130-150 days after the full bloom stage depending upon the variety grown. The ripening of fruits is associated with the change in colour, texture, quality and the development of the characteristic flavour. The fruits at the time of harvest should be uniform, firm and crisp. The colour of the skin at maturity ranges from yellow-red depending on the variety. However, the optimum time of harvest depends on fruit quality and intended period of storage. Due to the introduction of dwarf rootstock hand picking is recommended as it reduces bruising due to fruit fall during mechanical harvesting
