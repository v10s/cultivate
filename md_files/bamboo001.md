# Bamboo 
## Choice of Location 
Most bamboos thrive in moist, well-drained soil. They can be grown in most soil types, but some do better in acid soil - avoid wet, boggy or dry conditions. Most bamboos prefer sun but some species, such as Sasa bamboos, can be grown in shade. 
## Weather Requirements 
The bamboo plantation grows well in hot to warm temperate climatic conditions. But it must be remembered that it doesn't require temperature below 15 degree Celsius in the summers. Since the bamboo has thin roots as well as ample growth, you must make provisions to protect it from strong winds 
## Culitvation 
  - ### Soil Preparation 
    Bamboo plantation also requires well drained sandy soil to clay soil that should have a ph range of 4.5 to 6.0. If we talk about India, then the Barack Valley region is best suited for bamboo cultivation due to best soil and perfect climate conditions. 
  - ### Seeding 
    Soak your bamboo seeds in water for 1 full day. Fill up a shallow glass container up with water that is right around 85° F (30° C). Place your seeds into the water and let them sit undisturbed for between 12-24 hours. This kickstarts the germination process for your seeds and increases the odds of planting success. 
  - ### Planting 
    Usually bamboo planting is done in the rainy season. The pits size of 60*60 must be digged and nursery-raised seedlings should be planted at a space of 5*4 meter. The number of bamboo plants that can be placed in 1 acre land is about 200. The gestation period in bamboo planting is 5 years. 
  - ### Careing 
    For the first two years in the ground, water your bamboo well. Fertilize once in the spring. If you are trying to prevent running bamboo from, well, running… don’t fertilize as often. Prune back to the ground old, dull culms every year. (Culms are the upright "blades" of bamboo.) Some gardeners prefer to prune off any branches that extend horizontally, so that all culms run vertically straight up for a graphic and striking effect. If you have culms flopping over, they probably require more water, less feritlizer. You can prune back the height to help them recover, or just prune them down altogether. Bamboo loves water. As long as the soil is well drained. 
  - ### Harvesting 
    The harvesting can be started from the fifth year onwards. On the other hand, in case of commercial farming, harvesting must be done from the sixth year. In the first harvest - sixth year, 6 culms can be harvested followed by 7 culms in the seventh year and so on.
