# Cotton
Cotton is a soft fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll or protective case around the seeds of the cotton plants can contain minor percentages of waxes fats pectins and water 
## Choice of Location 
Plant cotton seeds in a location with loose, rich soil where the plants will receive at least four or five hours of direct sunlight every day. You can grow it in a container, but the container must be at least 36 inches (91 cm.) deep 
## Weather Requirements 
It prefers warm and humid climate. Cotton seeds will have a small germination rate, if the soil temperature is below 60�F (15�C). During active growth, the ideal air temperature is 70 to 100�F (21-37�C). Temperatures well above 100�F are not desirable. 
## Culitvation 
  - ### Soil Preparation 
    Cotton is sown on ridges and furrows. For irrigated cotton the land is given a deep ploughing followed by two harrowings. Ridges and furrows having different spacing for irrigated and rainfed cotton. For irrigated cotton shallow ridges on 90cm spacing should be prepared which helps in irrigation. 
  - ### Seeding 
    Plant cotton seeds in a location with loose, rich soil where the plants will receive at least four or five hours of direct sunlight every day. You can grow it in a container, but the container must be at least 36 inches (91 cm.) deep. It helps to work an inch (2.5 cm.) or so of compost into the soil before planting 
  - ### Planting 
    Producers who plant using no-till or conservation tillage methods, use special equipment designed to plant the seed through the litter that covers the soil surface. Producers who employ conventional tillage practices, plow or "list" the land into rows forming firm seed-beds for planting. 
  - ### Careing 
    Cut foliage and branches from surrounding taller trees if necessary to ensure that your cottonwood gets full sun.Water your cottonwood at least once a week in hot weather. Black cottonwood prefers soil that is wet to moist, while other types grow fine in soil with wet to dry conditions.Test the pH of your soil to give your cottonwoods the best growing conditions. Fremont and Eastern cottonwoods are tolerant of all pH levels, from acidic to alkaline, while black cottonwood grows best in soil that is acidic to neutral. 
  - ### Harvesting 
    The first step in cotton processing is harvesting, and for the farmers, it�s an important and personal process. It�s the culmination of months of planting and tending, and it�s the most important step before the cotton begins its traceability journey from the gin to the mill.After the crop matures, harvesting begins. Harvesting too soon can disrupt maturation, negatively affecting the fiber quality while waiting too long can result in a reduced fiber yield.
